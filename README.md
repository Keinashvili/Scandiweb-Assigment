# Scandiweb Assigment

This repo contains scandiweb test assigment.

P.S The javascript part is mostly googled, but the idea is mine.

http://167.172.183.228/ This is a link to the hosted website. I tested the following link on other networks, devices and it works. 
HTML and CSS aren't perfect but I to my mind it isn't that important. 

## In order to run the project locally 
Follow these steps
### Go to directory and run composer install
```
composer install
```
### After that go to public directory and run server
```
cd public
```
```
php -S localhost:8080
```
or on any port you want.

### Connect to Database.
You need to open config.php file and configure database properties.
## I hope u will like it!
